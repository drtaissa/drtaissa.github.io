I supervise various student projects at the School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University, Clayton campus.

In general, I work in the area of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which are a late evolutionary stage of stars similar to our Sun. Such a star will expel a lot of material during its death throes, which goes on to form an expanding circumstellar envelope around the star. All sorts of molecules form in these circumstellar envelopes and they are a one of the main places where cosmic dust first forms. Much of my research focusses on the molecular content of AGB circumstellar envelopes and what different molecules can tell us about the stars they originated from.

## Molecular lines in the AGB star AFGL 5379 as observed with the APEX telescope

AFGL 5379 is an AGB star that started its life with an intermediate mass (somewhere between 4 and 8 solar masses). It is currently what is known as an "extreme OH/IR star", which means that it has a very thick and dusty circumstellar envelope. The molecular content of stars like this has not yet been studied in great detail, however there are some hints that more unusual molecules might form in their dusty envelopes.

I have new observations of AFGL 5379 which has not yet been analysed. The data is a spectral scan taken with the APEX telescope. The goal of such a scan is to detect all the molecular lines that are present in the frequency ranges that were scanned, in this case from 160–210 GHz and 280–375 GHz. The kinds of molecular signatures we expect to find are rotational transition lines. Your first job will be to reduce the data and to identify all the lines present in the observed spectra. Then, depending on your interests, we can choose one or more molecular species to study in more detail.
