I am available to supervise various projects at the School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University, Clayton campus.

In general, I work in the area of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which are a late evolutionary stage of stars similar to our Sun. Such a star will expel a lot of material during its death throes, which goes on to form an expanding circumstellar envelope around the star. All sorts of molecules form in these circumstellar envelopes and they are a one of the main places where cosmic dust first forms. Much of my research focusses on the molecular content of AGB circumstellar envelopes and what different molecules can tell us about the stars they originated from.
