I am an ARC DECRA Fellow based at at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. I study evolved stars and the molecules around them. In particular, I am interested in how the molecular content around these stars changes over time, forms dust, and ultimately enriches the interstellar medium, hence contributing to the chemical evolution of the galaxy.
