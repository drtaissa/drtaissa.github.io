I am a researcher at KU Leuven in Belgium. I study evolved stars and the molecules around them. In particular, I am interested in how the molecular content around these stars changes over time, forms dust, and ultimately enriches the interstellar medium, hence contributing to the chemical evolution of the galaxy.
