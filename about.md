I am a researcher at KU Leuven in Belgium. I study evolved stars and the molecules around them. In particular, I am interested in how the molecular content around these stars changes over time, forms dust, and ultimately enriches the interstellar medium, hence contributing to the chemical evolution of the galaxy.

You can find me on Twitter [@stellalchemist](https://twitter.com/stellalchemist), though I do not tweet regularly.
