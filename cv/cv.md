##TEACHING


###Tutor, Institute of Astronomy, KU Leuven, Belgium 2017 – present
I led the exercise and assignment classes for the Stellar Atmospheres and Stellar Winds Masters level course. This
involved setting and explaining the assignments, and generally facilitating the students’ understanding of the topics.

###TA, Dept of Earth and Space Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden 2014 – 2015
As teaching assistant for the Masters level course Stellar Physics, I wrote an assignment in consultation with the
lecturer for the subject and marked the assignments handed in by the students.

###Tutor, Dept of Earth and Space Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden 2012 – 2016
I led exercise classes for the Space Science and Techniques Masters level course. This involved going through
assigned problems with the class of 15–25 students and answering their questions in person and via email.

###Exam Marker, School of Physics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia 2009 – 2011
As part of a team, I marked first year undergraduate physics exams. We were each given a question and asked to
grade that question according to a mark scheme on 300–500 students’ exams. I worked in a small group of two or
three to ensure that the question we marked was marked fairly and consistently over the entire cohort.

###Tutor, School of Physics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia 2010 – 2011
I took tutorial classes of undergraduate physics students. With classes of 12–20 students, I revised the material they
had learnt in lectures the previous week and helped them work through exercises. My role also included shifts in the
First Year Learning Centre, where first years physics students could come in during their lunch breaks and have any
questions they had answered. I also marked tests and assignments.

###Laboratory Notes Revisor, School of Physics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia 2010 – 2011
I revised first year physics lab notes to reflect changes in the course and structure of the laboratory work. Given some
basic guidelines as to the length the laboratory exercises needed to be and what needed to be added in or taken out,
I edited, rewrote and rearranged the existing laboratory notes to meet the new guidelines. This included making up
some new exercises for the students to do, allocating marks for various sections of each laboratory exercise and
restructuring the exercises to fit into new time constraints.

###Laboratory Demonstrator, School of Physics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia 2009 – 2011
I ran lab classes for first year undergraduate physics students. This entailed supervising a group of twelve to eighteen
students while they performed a practical exercise as well as offering them help and advice. My role in each class
was to teach them what they needed to know to do the practical, especially if they had not yet covered the physics
in lectures, and to make sure they stayed on track for the three hour session. Afterwards, I marked the students’ lab
books, which accounted for the 20% laboratory work contribution to their final physics mark.


###Teaching Assistant, School of Physics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia 2010
I assisted a lecturer teaching Introduction to Climate Change to undergraduate students. My roles included managing
online content and helping with lecture slide preparation.

###Private Tutor, Australia 2006 – 2010
I privately tutored year 10, 11 and 12 high school students in VCE and IB Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.



##OUTREACH

###Day of Science (Dag van de Wetenschap), Leuven, Belgium 2018
  I helped run a demonstration of an infrared camera in the Leuven library as part of a large outreach event across KU
Leuven campuses.

###Open Door Day, Science Faculty, KU Leuven, Belgium 2017
  I helped run some of the astronomy demonstrations as visitors passed through the department, explained what sort of
astronomy our group studies and answered any questions they might have had.

###Outreach, Onsala Space Observatory, Sweden 2011 – 2016
  I performed many different outreach duties during my time at Onsala Space Observatory. These have ranged from
giving guided tours of the observatory, and talking to members of the public about astronomy and the observatory
during open day events. I also coordinated updating the astronomy exhibition with more modern images and
information.

###Work Experience, School of Physics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia 2010 – 2011
  The Astro Group hosted a group of year 10 (high school) students undertaking a week of work experience each year.
During those weeks, I supervised them for a lab session, the focus of which was to build their interest in physics
while familiarising them with basic astrophysical concepts, and presented an hour-long lecture introducing them to
an aspect of astronomy and astrophysics. I also helped to supervise some of their other miscellaneous activities
throughout their visit.

###Student Host at Orientation Week, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia 2008, 2010
  I helped orientate new first year students to the university campus by showing them around, answering their
questions about university life and explaining other important things they needed to know about starting their new
courses.

###Open Day Guide, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia 2008 – 2009
In 2008 I worked as a general Open Day Guide. My role was to direct prospective students and their parents around
campus, answer their questions and to inform them of various activities taking place on Open Day. In 2009 I worked
in the School of Physics on Open Day, running physics-based demonstrations and directing students to other
information points around the school and the university.

###n-2-Science Mentor, Melbourne, Australia 2007
Once a week, I went to a year 9 high school science class to help the teacher engage the students. As well as helping
out with their normal classwork, I often spoke to them about various areas of science with the aim of encouraging
them to pursue scientific studies in later years.


##MEMBERSHIPS

I helped organise events that the group ran, for example by making posters advertising events and chairing a forum.
My role also included managing the mailing list for all members of Women in Physics and sending out
announcements as needed.

###Graduate Transition Roles, University of Melbourne, Parkville 2010
I participated in a graduate orientation session entitled “Studying at Melbourne: Strategies for Success” run by the
Academic Skills Unit. I participated in a discussion examining study strategies for commencing graduate students
and some of the pitfalls to avoid. I also participated in a Graduate Transition Forum as the Student Panellist.

###Member of Student-Staff Liaison Committee, University of Melbourne, Parkville 2007 – 2009
I was a member of the Student-Staff Liaison Committee for the Department of Mathematics and Statistics (2007–
2008) and the School of Physics (2008–2009). In this role I collected student feedback on various aspects of a
particular subject and reported this feedback to the committee which acted to make changes where appropriate
